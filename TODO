TODO List for HMBuilder:

- Need to add bottom/top water temperature differences for core model.
Currently, both ends of the reactor core have a mono-temp moderator,
which throws off the k-eff of the final calculation as well as causing
larger than normal sample variance. I.e., the final paper needs this
fix as I'm going to have to A) provide the expected k-eff for runtimes
I give, verifiable by a run without tallies at all (easily done, and I
should do this anyhow), and B) provide a cross-sectional picture of
the core, which may look inaccurate given the lack of temperature bias
in the core.
